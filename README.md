# AWS Speech to Text using Python
In this repositry you can find the python code for converting Speech to text using Amazon Transcriber. 
I have taken few codes from tscribe for decoding the transcript (json to excel). You can find more other functions like storing the result in txt, docx etc., when you use the package tscribe.
